### Week 6: I/O Operations  

#### **Objective:**  
Enable basic input/output operations for the Virtual CPU by simulating I/O devices and integrating them with the CPU's instruction set.  

---

### **Core Concepts:**  
- **Simulated I/O Devices:**  
  Virtual representations of hardware devices like keyboards and displays to handle input and output operations.  

- **I/O Instructions:**  
  Special CPU instructions for managing I/O operations, allowing data transfer between devices and memory/registers.  

- **Integration with CPU:**  
  Extending the instruction set to include I/O operations and ensuring smooth execution.

### **Simulated I/O Devices**  

#### Tasks to Implement:  
1. **Keyboard (Input):**  
   - Simulate a keyboard that allows the user to provide input during program execution.  
   - Input data will be stored in the CPU's memory or a specific register.  

2. **Display (Output):**  
   - Simulate a simple display to show text or data from registers/memory.  
   - Output data will be formatted for clarity.

### **Steps to Implement**  

#### 1. Define Simulated I/O Devices  
- Represent devices as classes or modules to encapsulate functionality.  
- Example: A `Keyboard` class for input, a `Display` class for output.  

#### 2. Extend CPU Instruction Set  
- Add new instructions for handling I/O, such as:  
  - **`IN`:** Read data from an input device into a register.  
  - **`OUT`:** Write data from a register to an output device.  

#### 3. Test I/O Operations  
- Create small programs that use the new I/O instructions.  
- Example: Reading user input into a register and displaying it on the screen.

### **Setting Up Simulated I/O Devices**  

#### **Keyboard Input:**  
- Data entered by the user will be stored in a queue for the CPU to process.  

#### **Display Output:**  
- Data written to the display will be formatted and printed on the console for simplicity.  

#### **Integration:**  
- Ensure the CPU fetches, decodes, and executes I/O instructions correctly.  

---

### **Future Enhancements**  
1. **Interrupts:**  
   - Add interrupt-driven I/O for asynchronous input/output handling.  

2. **I/O Mapped Memory:**  
   - Use specific memory addresses for communicating with I/O devices.  

3. **Advanced Devices:**  
   - Simulate more complex devices, such as file storage or network interfaces.  

---

### **Explanation of Design**  

#### **Simulated I/O Device Classes:**  
- Encapsulate I/O functionality for clarity and reusability.  

#### **Instruction Handling:**  
- New instructions are integrated into the CPUâ€™s decode-execute cycle, ensuring seamless operation.  

#### **Scalability:**  
- The design can support additional devices and more complex I/O instructions in the future.
