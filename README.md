<h1>Virtual CPU Emulator</h1>

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Virtual CPU Emulator project.CPU Virtulization is focuses on creating a virtual model of a computers CPU.This virtual CPU can then be used to run software that was written for a different type of CPU,or to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical CPU. that was written for a different type of The project will be divided into 10 weeks. Each week, specific tasks will be
    assigned. Groups will be evaluated based on the accuracy, completeness, and depth
    of the work submitted.</p>

<h1>Scope: </h1>
<p>This project is to create a basic virtual CPU emulator that replicates core CPU processes, like instruction execution and memory management.</p>

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>The main objective is to deeply understand CPU design and functionality by building a virtual emulator from scratch. This involves:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Build a Functional CPU Core (Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle)</li>
    <li>Create an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)</li>
    <li>Develop Memory and Register Management</li>
</ul>

## Weekly Tasks Overview 

### [Week 1: Project Planning & Setup](https://github.com/bashirnubtk/Virtual-CPU-Emulator/tree/main/Week%201)
