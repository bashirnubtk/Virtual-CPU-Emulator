# Week 3: Basic CPU Components

## Concept of ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a critical component of a CPU, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. Typically, it handles the following:

 1. **Arithmetic Operations:**  Such as addition (ADD), subtraction (SUB), multiplication (MUL), and division (DIV).
 2. **Logical Operations:** Such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.
 3. **Comparison:** Determines whether one number is equal to, less than, or greater than another.

## Implementing General-Purpose Registers (GPRs)
In a CPU, General-Purpose Registers (GPRs) are small, fast storage locations used to temporarily hold data during processing. These registers are crucial for efficient computation and serve as operands for the ALU.

#### **Design Goals for General-Purpose Registers:**
 - Store intermediate results and data.
 - Allow data to be read and written quickly.
 - Integrate with the ALU for operations.
