### Week 5: Memory Management

#### Objective:

Implementing a simulated memory space for the Virtual CPU to manage memory operations effectively.

#### Core Concepts:

1. **Simulated Memory Space:**
   A virtual memory model that mimics physical memory, enabling read/write operations and memory segmentation.

2. **Address Mapping:**
   Translating logical addresses into physical addresses to access the correct memory locations.

3. **Memory Segmentation:**
   Dividing memory into segments to organize and manage data more efficiently.

### Setting Up a Simulated Memory Space

#### Steps to Implement:

1. **Define the Memory Size:**

   - Memory is represented as a fixed-size list (e.g., 1 KB = 1024 bytes).

2. **Initialize Memory:**

   - Start with all memory locations initialized to `0` to represent an empty state.

3. **Display Memory:**

   - Implement a mechanism to visualize the memory contents, showing data in a structured format.

4. **Scalability:**

   - The design should support larger memory sizes and segmentation for future tasks.

#### Explanation of Code:

1. **`Memory`**** Class:**

   - Represents the simulated memory space.
   - Contains methods for initialization and visualization.

2. **Initialization:**

   - Memory is a list with a fixed size, filled with zeros.

3. **display memory Method:**

   - Outputs the memory contents in 16-byte chunks, with hexadecimal formatting for clarity.

4. **Example Usage:**

   - A memory size of 1 KB is defined.
   - The initial state of the memory is displayed, showing all locations as `0`.

#### Future Enhancements:

1. **Read/Write Operations:**

   - Enable reading from and writing to specific memory locations.

2. **Address Mapping:**

   - Implement address translation for logical to physical address mapping.

3. **Memory Segmentation:**

   - Divide memory into logical segments (e.g., code, data, stack).
