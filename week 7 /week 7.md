### **Week 7: Advanced CPU Features**  

#### **Objective:**  
Enhance the Virtual CPU by adding advanced features such as branching, subroutine handling, interrupts, and a basic pipeline mechanism.  

---

### **Core Concepts:**  

#### **Branching and Control Flow:**  
- Adding support for conditional and unconditional jump instructions to control the execution flow dynamically.  

#### **Subroutines:**  
- Enabling reusable code blocks with the implementation of `CALL` and `RETURN` instructions for efficient execution and modularity.  

#### **Interrupt Handling:**  
- Introducing interrupt mechanisms to manage asynchronous events, allowing the CPU to pause and resume execution as needed.  

#### **Pipeline Mechanism:**  
- Basic pipelining to improve CPU efficiency by overlapping instruction fetching, decoding, and execution stages.

### **Steps to Implement:**  

#### 1. **Branching Instructions:**  
   - Define conditional and unconditional jump instructions (e.g., `JMP`, `JZ`, `JNZ`).  
   - Modify the instruction execution phase to handle branching based on specific conditions.  

#### 2. **Subroutines:**  
   - Implement `CALL` to save the return address on the stack and jump to the subroutine.  
   - Add `RETURN` to retrieve the return address from the stack and resume execution.  

#### 3. **Interrupts:**  
   - Introduce interrupt service routines (ISR) and a vector table to store interrupt addresses.  
   - Add an interrupt handling mechanism to pause the main program, execute the ISR, and resume the main program.  

#### 4. **Pipeline:**  
   - Implement a three-stage pipeline: fetch, decode, and execute.  
   - Overlap these stages to process multiple instructions simultaneously, improving performance.

### **Explanation of Code:**  

#### **Branching and Control Flow:**  
- Adds conditional jump instructions based on register values (e.g., `JZ` for jumping if zero).  

#### **Subroutines:**  
- Saves the current program counter (PC) to the stack before jumping to a subroutine.  
- Restores the PC from the stack during a return.  

#### **Interrupt Handling:**  
- Checks for interrupts during each cycle and handles them by jumping to predefined ISRs.  

#### **Pipeline Mechanism:**  
- Splits instruction execution into stages and overlaps them for faster execution.

### **Future Enhancements:**  
1. **Enhanced Pipeline:**  
   - Add hazard detection and resolution for better pipeline management.  
2. **Interrupt Prioritization:**  
   - Introduce priority levels for interrupts to handle critical tasks efficiently.  
3. **Complex Subroutines:**  
   - Implement parameter passing and local variables for more robust subroutine functionality.
