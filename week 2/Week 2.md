# Week 2: Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
## Assembler Program Description

The Assembler Program is a tool designed to convert assembly code into machine code. It allows users to write assembly instructions, which are then translated into the binary code that a CPU can execute.

### ADD
**Operations** : Adds the values of two registers or a register and a memory location, storing the result in a target register.

**Format** : ADD R1, R2 (Adds the contents of R2 to R1 and stores the result in R1). 

### SUB (Subtraction)

**Operation**:Subtracts the value of one register or memory location from another, storing the result in a target register.

**Format** : SUB R1, R2 (Subtracts the contents of R2 from R1 and stores the result in R1). 

### LOAD (Load Data into Register)

**Operation** :Loads data from memory into a register.

**Example**: LOAD R1, [100] (Loads the value from memory address 100 into register R1).
