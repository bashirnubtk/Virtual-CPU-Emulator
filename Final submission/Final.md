# Virtual CPU Emulator

## Overview

This project is a **Virtual CPU Emulator** designed to simulate basic CPU operations, including an instruction set, memory management, and input/output operations. It includes features such as branching, subroutines, and performance optimizations to enhance efficiency.

## Features

- Custom **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** for basic computations
- **Memory management** with read/write operations
- **Input/Output simulation** (keyboard, display)
- **Branching, control flow, and subroutines**
- **Performance optimizations** (memory caching, efficient execution pipeline)

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or later
- Git for version control (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/virtual-cpu.git
   cd virtual-cpu
   ```
2. Run the emulator:
   ```bash
   python emulator.py
   ```

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

| Opcode           | Description                                 | Example Usage          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| LOAD             | Load value from memory to register          | `LOAD R0, 10`          |
| STORE            | Store value from register to memory         | `STORE 20, R1`         |
| ADD              | Add two registers and store in another      | `ADD R1, R2, R3`       |
| SUB              | Subtract two registers and store in another | `SUB R1, R2, R3`       |
| JUMP             | Jump to a memory address                    | `JUMP 15`              |
| BRANCH\_IF\_ZERO | Branch if register value is zero            | `BRANCH_IF_ZERO R1, 8` |
| CALL             | Call a subroutine at a specific address     | `CALL 12`              |
| RETURN           | Return from subroutine                      | `RETURN`               |
| HALT             | Stop execution                              | `HALT`                 |

## Running a Sample Program

You can load a sample program into memory and run the CPU:

```python
program = [
    ("LOAD", 0, 10),       # Load value from memory[10] into register 0
    ("ADD", 1, 0, 0),      # Add register 0 to register 0 and store in register 1
    ("STORE", 20, 1),      # Store value from register 1 into memory[20]
    ("BRANCH_IF_ZERO", 1, 8),  # If register 1 is zero, jump to address 8
    ("CALL", 12),          # Call subroutine at address 12
    ("HALT",),             # Halt the program
    ("LOAD", 2, 20),       # Subroutine: Load value from memory[20] into register 2
    ("ADD", 2, 2, 0),      # Add register 0 to register 2 and store in register 2
    ("RETURN",),           # Return from subroutine
]
```

## Debugging & Performance Optimization

### Debugging Steps

- Run test programs to verify correct execution
- Handle **invalid opcodes** and **out-of-bounds memory access**
- Use print statements or logging for debugging

### Optimization Techniques

- **Memory caching** for frequently accessed instructions
- **Instruction pipeline** to reduce execution delay
- **Error handling** for smooth execution

## Final Testing

- Validate with **complex assembly programs**
- Debug using **test cases and benchmarks**
- Optimize for **better execution speed**

## Conclusion

This **Virtual CPU Emulator** is designed to provide an educational and functional simulation of a basic CPU. It supports a range of features to enhance its usability and performance.
